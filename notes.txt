Problem: total hours only counts the hours for the current page, not all data.
Possible solution: query the sum of hours in the routes.py, then pass it to index.html.
Setbacks: monthly total hours cannot be counted (?) no solution i can think of so far....

SQLAlchemy pagination setbacks: inaccurate TOTAL HOURS!!!!!!
possiblt solution: try JS pagination???
